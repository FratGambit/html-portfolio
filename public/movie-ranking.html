    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
    <hr />
    
    <h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
    <p>An amazing film by Martin Scorsese. This movie paints a beautiful picture of a man who is isolated and alienated from the society in which he lives. The depiction of the main character is spot-on. The way the camera moves, the way the characters converse, and the color grading all help us feel the inner psyche of the main character. <em>Taxi Driver</em> stands out for its raw portrayal of urban isolation and its intense character study, making it a timeless classic in cinema.</p>
    
    <h3>Wind River</h3>
    <p>This is a movie where you feel the cold both physically and figuratively. A line from the film sums up the entire scenario: "Wolves don't kill unlucky deer." The people in this area live in a very unforgiving environment. In this place, you have to be strong in order to survive; luck does not help here. Because the people are neglected and no one cares about them, they live in an isolated community. This movie depicts life in a Native American reservation very vividly. <em>Wind River</em> not only tells a gripping story but also sheds light on the harsh realities faced by those living on the fringes of society.</p>
    
    <h3>Rear Window</h3>
    <p>The entirety of the film takes place in a room where the main character watches the other apartments. It demonstrates that if you sell your story to the audience, you can create excitement even with just one room for filming. The director builds suspense brilliantly throughout the movie. <em>Rear Window</em> is a masterclass in tension and storytelling, showing how a confined space can become a stage for gripping drama and intrigue.</p>
